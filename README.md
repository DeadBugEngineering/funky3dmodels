# funky3dmodels
This is a place for me to share some of my functional 3d printing models that I've designed while working on my side projects. 

## DIN rail mounting hardware (18mm)
The models in this folder are designed to be used in conjunction with the [DIN rail clip made by PlasticXYZ](https://www.printables.com/model/161740-din-rail-clip/files). This DIN rail clip design screws into the mounting hardware using two M3 screws that are 18mm apart from each other.

## Toolrack_508mm
This toolrack materialized after I got my hands on a bunch of left-over Heitec_3685268 extruded aluminum cross-braces for a 19inch chassis and a Bambulabs X1 printer. The distance between the 2.5mm screws that fixes the modules to the aluminum part is 5.08mm on the x-axis and either 100mm for the long modules or 50mm for the short modules on the y-axis. All modules have a little flap in the front to attach some labels. 

## Random tools for makers
### M3_nutty_fork
If you have to thread on a bunch of M3 nuts onto a bolt in tight spaces, the nutty_fork makes this annoying task a breeze instead of rage inducing. Simply place the nuts onto a flat surface and fork them up with this tool and put them on the threaded bolt.
