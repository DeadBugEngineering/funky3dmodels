# funky3dmodels
This is a place for me to share some of my functional 3d printing models that I've designed while working on my side projects.

## DIN rail mounting hardware (18mm)
The models in this folder are designed to be used in conjunction with the [DIN rail clip made by PlasticXYZ](https://www.printables.com/model/161740-din-rail-clip/files). This DIN rail clip design screws into the mounting hardware using two M3 screws that are 18mm apart from each other.

## Random tools for makers
### M3_nutty_fork
If you have to thread on a bunch of M3 nuts onto a bolt in tight spaces, the nutty_fork makes this annoying task a breeze instead of rage inducing. Simply place the nuts onto a flat surface and fork them up with this tool.
